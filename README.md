# Planetary_Systems_Visualization

I had the privilege of attending Harvard Summer School in the year 2020 through Summer of a Lifetime. 
I attended an intro to data visualization class and ended the course creating a 3d interactive movie of the kepler 11 pllanetary system using a variety of visualization libraries and methods.
