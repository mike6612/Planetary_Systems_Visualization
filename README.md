# Planetary_Systems_Visualization

I had the privilege of attending Harvard Summer School in the year 2020 through Summer of a Lifetime. 

I attended an intro to data visualization class and ended the course creating a 3D interactive movie of the Kepler-11 planetary system using a variety of visualization libraries and methods, the NASA planet archive data, and utilizing Jupter Notebook and Python.
