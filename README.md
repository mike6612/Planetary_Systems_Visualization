# Planetary_Systems_Visualization

I had the privilege of attending Harvard Summer School in the year 2020 through Summer of a Lifetime. 

I attended an intro to data visualization class and ended the course creating a 3D interactive movie of the Kepler-11 planetary system using a variety of visualization libraries and methods, gatherhing and sorting data from the NASA planet archive, and utilizing Jupter Notebook and Python.

Kepler-11 is one of the planetary systems discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope and is located 2,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Cygnus.
It contains at least six confirmed exoplanets, which are thought to be larger than Earth, with sizes ranging from about 2 to 4 times the diameter of Earth. They orbit their host star, Kepler-11, in relatively tight orbits.
